### Hello there! My name is Michael Garstka 
I am a final-year DPhil (PhD) student at the University of Oxford (Trinity College) 👨‍🎓.
I spent most of my time on research about convex optimisation and its applications 👨‍💻. I am also the main developer of [COSMO.jl](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/COSMO.jl), a solver for convex conic problems.
